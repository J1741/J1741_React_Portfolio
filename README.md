# J1741 React Portfolio

## Overview

This repo contains my updated portfolio page, which has been refactored to use React. This updated portfolio has been deployed on GitHub pages at the following URL: https://j1741.github.io/professional_materials/

## Updates to Professional Materials

Updates in this set of professional materials include the following:

### Updates to Portfolio Page

The content of the About Me section was streamlined and polished.

The gallery of featured applications was updated to include a weather dashboard application, which produces forecasts from calls to openweathermap.org's API.

- the first-featured application is The Beverage Viber (full-stack)
- the second-featured application is Vibe Cloud (front-end)
- the third-featured application is the E-Commerce Backend app (full-stack)
- the fourth-featured application is the Team Profile Generator (full-stack)
- the fifth-featured application is the Password Generator (front-end)
- the sixth-featured application is the Weather Dashboard (front-end + API calls)

Screenshots of the featured applications were moved out of the repo referenced via links to reduce the size of the codebase.

The layout of the page was updated to have a more modern and dynamic look-and-feel, using a combination of React components and vanilla Boostrap.

### Resume

_Direction for future development: I'd like to create a more developer-oriented resume, distinct from my current research-oriented one._

## React

### Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run deploy`

Deploys the latest build to GitHub pages: https://j1741.github.io/j1741_react_portfolio/

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
